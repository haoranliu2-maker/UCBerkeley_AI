Introduction:

The prompt.ipynb file contains an analysis of a survey describing different driving scenarios
(e.g. destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc.) and whether the driver will accept a coupon.
The analysis focuses on assessing the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupon.
In particular, this analysis focuses on customers who accepted the "Bar" and "Coffee House" coupons.

Findings - Bar Coupons:
In general, it seems like people who go to bars more frequently (at least once a month) are more likely to accept bar coupons.
Additionally, people who go to cheap restaurants more frequently and have lower incomes also seem more likely to accept bar coupons.
Social factors, such as having friends or partners as passengers, also appear to increase the likelihood of accepting bar coupons.
Overall, frequent social outings and certain demographic factors seem to influence the acceptance of bar coupons.

Findings - Coffee House Coupons:
The analysis suggests that frequent coffee drinkers who are younger, employed or studying, and have lower incomes are more inclined
to accept coffee house coupons compared to other segments of the population. Additional analysis, such as predictive modeling, should
include age, employment status, and income level, amongst other features within the dataset.
